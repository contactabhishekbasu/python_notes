# python_notes
This is Abhishek Basu's collection of personal notes on python, statistics, machine learning, product management and every thing in between. I'm currently revisiting everything from scratch and will try my best to cover them here. These notes are posted publically since I believe in easy access of knowledge. The right to a *quality education* should be a fundamental right!
